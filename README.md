###[ML in finance - Ridge Regression, Trees, K-Means](/MLFinanceHandbook(RidgeRegression,DecisionTree,KMeans).pdf) ###


This marketing handbook provides basic and technical guides for 3 different types of machine learning models that includes classification trees, ridge regression, and K-mean clustering models. Here is the [python notebook](/ML_FinanceHandbook(RidgeRegression,DecisionTree,KMeans).ipynb)

###[ML in finance - LDA, SVM, NN](/MLFinanceHandbook(LDA,SVM,NN).pdf) ###


SVM is commonly used for bioinformatics, text classification and image classification. LDA is frequently used for text classification, computer vision and face recognition. NN is widely used for natural language processing, speech recognition, image and video recognition. Here is the [python notebook](/ML_FinanceHandbook(LDA,SVM,NN).ipynb)

###[ML in finance - Hyper-parameter Tuning, Ensemble Learning](/MLFinanceHandbook(HyperparameterTuning,Ensemble).pdf) ###

‘Issue 1: Optimizing in Hyper-parameters’ and ‘Issue 3: Applying Ensemble Learning’ by describing two sections (Non-technical and Technical) for each issue. Here is the [python notebook](/ML_FinanceHandbook(HyperparameterTuning,Ensemble).ipynb)
